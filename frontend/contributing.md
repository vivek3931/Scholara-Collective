## Getting Started with Development

To set up your local development environment, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) file in the project's root directory. It contains detailed instructions on prerequisites, installation, configuration, and running the application.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following guidelines:

  * **MERN Stack Best Practices:** Adhere to best practices for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js development.
  * **Readability:** Write clean, well-commented, and easily understandable code.
  * **Testing:** Whenever possible, include unit and integration tests for new features and bug fixes.
