# Scholara Collective: A MERN Stack Academic Resource Hub

## Project Overview

**Scholara Collective** (formerly Scholara Collective) is an open-source platform designed to empower students globally by providing free, organized access to a vast array of academic resources. It addresses the critical need for accessible and well-structured study materials, fostering a collaborative community where students can share and improve learning resources.

### Problem Statement

Access to quality academic resources is often fragmented, expensive, or difficult to navigate. Students frequently face challenges in finding reliable study materials, collaborating effectively, and organizing their academic assets efficiently.

### Objective

To develop a scalable, community-driven platform using the MERN stack that centralizes academic resources, promotes collaboration, and enhances learning for students worldwide.

## Key Features

  * **Resource Upload & Management:** Seamlessly upload, categorize, and manage various academic materials (notes, question papers, e-books, etc.).
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Efficiently find resources using intelligent search capabilities and robust filtering options.
  * **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user accounts with distinct roles and permissions.
  * **Community & Collaboration:** Features to foster interaction, sharing, and peer learning.
  * **Analytics & Insights (Premium - Optional):** Provide users with data on resource popularity and engagement.

## Technology Stack

Scholara Collective is built using the **MERN Stack**, leveraging modern web technologies for a robust and scalable application:

  * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
  * **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  * **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a dynamic and responsive frontend.
  * **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for server-side logic.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, typically organized into `backend` and `frontend` directories, along with common utilities and configuration files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  * npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
  * MongoDB

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scholara-collective.git
    cd scholara-collective
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and any other necessary environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```

    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
